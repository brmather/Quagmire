**Quagmire is a Python surface process framework for building erosion and deposition models on highly parallel, decomposed structured and unstructured meshes.**

Quagmire is structured into three major tiers that inherit methods and attributes from different classes:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/underworldcode/quagmire/dev/docs/images/quagmire-flowchart.png" style="width: 321px; float:right">

1. `SurfaceProcessMesh`
    - Calculate erosion-deposition rates
    - Landscape analysis
    - Long range flow models
2. `TopoMesh`
    - Assemble downhill connectivity matrix
    - Calculate upstream area
    - Compute slope
    - Identify flat spots, low points, high points.
3. `FlatMesh`
    - calculating spatial derivatives
    - identifying node neighbour relationships
    - interpolation / extrapolation
    - smoothing operators
    - importing and saving mesh information

The `quagmire.surfmesh.surfmesh.SurfMesh` class (1) inherits from
the `quagmire.topomesh.topomesh.TopoMesh` class (2), which in turn inherits from
the `quagmire.mesh.pixmesh.PixMesh`, `quagmire.mesh.trimesh.TriMesh`, or
`quagmire.mesh.strimesh.sTriMesh` class (3) depending on the type of mesh.


## Installation

Numpy and a fortran compiler, preferably [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran), are required to install Quagmire.

- ``python setup.py build``
   - If you change the fortran compiler, you may have to add the
flags `config_fc --fcompiler=<compiler name>` when setup.py is run
(see docs for [numpy.distutils](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/distutils.html)).
- ``python setup.py install``

## Dependencies

Running this code requires the following packages to be installed. The visualisation options are required for the notebooks and are included in the docker image.

- Python 2.7.x and above
- Numpy 1.9 and above
- Scipy 0.15 and above
- [mpi4py](http://pythonhosted.org/mpi4py/usrman/index.html)
- [petsc4py](https://pythonhosted.org/petsc4py/usrman/install.html)
- [stripy](https://github.com/University-of-Melbourne-Geodynamics/stripy)
- [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/mpi.html#building-against-parallel-hdf5) (optional - for saving parallel data)
- Matplotlib (optional - for visualisation)
- lavavu (optional - for visualisation)

### PETSc installation

PETSc is used extensively via the Python frontend, petsc4py. It is required that PETSc be configured and installed on your local machine prior to using Quagmire. You can use pip or petsc to install petsc4py and its dependencies with consistent versions.

```sh
[sudo] pip install numpy mpi4py
[sudo] pip install petsc petsc4py
```

If that fails you must compile these manually.

### HDF5 installation

This is an optional installation, but it is very useful for saving data that is distributed across multiple processes. If you are compiling HDF5 from [source](https://support.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html) it should be configured with the `--enable-parallel` flag:

```sh
CC=/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpicc ./configure --enable-parallel --enable-shared --prefix=<install-directory>
make    # build the library
make check  # verify the correctness
make install
```

You can then point to this install directory when you install [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/mpi.html#building-against-parallel-hdf5).

## Usage

Quagmire is scalable in parallel. All of the python scripts in the *tests* subdirectory can be run in parallel, e.g.

```sh
mpirun -np 4 python stream_power.py
```

where the number after the `-np` flag specifies the number of processors.

## Tutorials

Tutorials with worked examples can be found in the *Notebooks* subdirectory. These are Jupyter Notebooks that can be run locally.
We recommend installing [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to create videos in some of the notebooks.

The topics covered in the Notebooks include:

**Meshing**

Triangulations and regular 2d arrays are included and have the same API.

- Square mesh
- Elliptical mesh
- Mesh refinement (e.g. Lloyd's mesh improvement)

**Flow algorithms**

- Single and multiple downhill pathways
- Accumulating flow

**Erosion and deposition**

Operators for

- Long-range stream flow models
- Short-range diffusive evolution

**Landscape evolution**

_Work in progress_

- Explicit timestepping and numerical stability
- Landscape equilibrium metrics
- Basement uplift

**Benchmarking**

_Work in progress_
